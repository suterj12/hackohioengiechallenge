                Come visit our annual on-campus thrift store, featuring many items that were 
                collected last spring when students moved out of their residence halls—creating our own closed-loop recycling system on campus! Lots of great bargains, including clothing, fans, kitchen items, dorm-room organizers, shelving, rugs, wall-art…all for sale at greatly reduced prices. 
                Come outfit your room or apartment while getting some great deals!

                These clean-ups bring together students and community members with the goal of making our community cleaner, elevating the sense of pride we have in the Ohio State community, and positively impacting safety in the community. Throughout the course of these events, we will be collecting and disposing of loose trash and recycling in the University District.
